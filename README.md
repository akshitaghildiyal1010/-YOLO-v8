Developed an advanced object detection model using YOLOv8, fine-tuning it on a custom dataset to distinguish
cars. 
Curated and annotated video frames with bounding boxes for improved model accuracy.
Integrated a simple online real-time tracker (SORT) for consistent car tracking across frames, optimizing existing
algorithms for seamless YOLOv8 integration.
Used OpenCV for real-time video processing and frame extraction, optimizing for minimal latency
